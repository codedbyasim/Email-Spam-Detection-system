## 📧 Email Spam Detection System using Naive Bayes

This project is a simple yet effective **Spam Detection System** that uses the **Naive Bayes classifier** to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam**. It utilizes text preprocessing techniques, TF-IDF vectorization, and machine learning to build a spam filter based on the popular `spam.csv` dataset.

---

### 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm

* **Multinomial Naive Bayes** is used for classification because it performs well with text data and discrete features (like word counts or frequencies).

---

### 📂 Dataset

* Dataset: [`spam.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
* Columns:

  * `v1`: Label (spam/ham)
  * `v2`: Text message

---

### 🛠️ Features

* Text cleaning (punctuation removal, stopwords removal)
* Text stemming using **PorterStemmer**
* TF-IDF Vectorization
* Train-Test Split
* Model Training & Evaluation
* Performance metrics:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Report

---

### 🧪 Libraries Used

```python
pandas
numpy
string
nltk
sklearn
```

---

### 📊 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

* `Accuracy Score`
* `Confusion Matrix`
* `Classification Report`
